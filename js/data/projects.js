        description: "Designing the website for Padis was all about bringing the excitement of trading cards to life in a digital space. It wasn’t just about designing a storefront—it was about capturing the thrill of discovery, the nostalgia of collecting, and the energy of a community that shares a love for the game. Every element was crafted to reflect that passion, making the experience as immersive and engaging as stepping into the shop itself."
